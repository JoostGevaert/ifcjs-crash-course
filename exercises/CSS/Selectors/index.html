    <h3>CSS selector hierarchy</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>id=, # CSS selectors</li>
      <li>class=, . CSS selectors</li>
      <li>HTML element CSS selectors</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the CSS style sheet file, one should go from most generic to most
      specific. This refers to the hierarchy listed above, but also to the
      hierarchy of HTML elements. This serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it keeps
      the code clean and therefore easier to understand and maintain. Secondly,
      it prevents CSS bugs.

        Relational selectors can be used to refer to the children of basic
        selectors. e.g. div > p refers to all p that are children of a &lt;div&gt;.
